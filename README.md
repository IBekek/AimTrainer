# FPS Aim Trainer

FPS Aim Trainer was created simply because I wanted to get a game that would help me improve my performance in FPS titles without spending money in the store. Main game features are:

   * Different courses testing core aspects of FPS games (aiming, flicking, tracing)

   * Scores comparison and player's scoreboard for the day for a given course

   * Statistics panel showing player's improvement over the days played at a certain course

   * Simple options panel allowing for mouse sensitivity and inversion changes

The only asset not made by me was the graph plotter. I've been trying to figure out how to make my own, but I kept running into difficulties and finally decided on getting a working asset.

The gameplay itself is very simple, most of the time was spent learning about and implementing the systems that displayed, compared, and dealt with the scores and saves in general, depending on dates and maps.
