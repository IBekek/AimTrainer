# AimTrainer

FPS Aim Trainer was created simply because I wanted to get a game that would help me improve my performance in FPS titles, but felt that the trainers in the store weren't worth the money, so I made my own version. Project's features:

   * Different courses testing various aspects of FPS games

   * Scores comparison and player's scoreboard for the day for certain course

   * Statistics panel showing player's improvement over the days played at a certain course

   * Simple options panel allowing for mouse sensitivity and inversion changes

The only asset not made by me was the graph plotter. I've been trying to figure out how to make my own, but I kept running into difficulties and finally decided on getting a working asset.

The gameplay itself is very simple, most of the time was spent learning about and implementing the systems that displayed, compared, and dealt with the scores and saves in general, depending on dates and maps.
